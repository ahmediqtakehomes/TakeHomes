# **[Overview]{.underline}** 

In this exercise, you will use your machine learning experience to solve
a straightforward but challenging prediction​ ​problem.​ ​The​ ​exercise​
​contains ​ two​ ​ parts​

> 1\. Building​ ​a​ ​machine​ ​learning​ model​ ​ ​for​ ​a​ ​prediction ​ task​ 2.
> Writing ​ an​ ​ application​ ​ to​ ​ make​ ​ ​predictions ​ using​ ​ ​that​ ​model.

In Part 1, we would love to have you exhibit your modeling skills. You
will be evaluated on the following - performance on the test set,
feature engineering choices including features used and encoding of
features, data processing, choice of models used, description of model
performance and insights and observations from the​ ​model.

Part 2 is your chance to show off your software engineering skills. This
includes performance of the application, adherence to common software
engineering patterns (unit tests, modular code, etc.) and ability to
make educated​ ​trade-offs​ ​based​ ​on​ ​the​ ​given ​ constraints.​

**NOTE:** For​ this part, you must use a production ready language like
Python, Java, C++, Scala, Ruby, etc. If you are ​ unsure​ ​ if​ ​ your​ ​
language​ ​​of ​ choice​ ​ is​ ​ ​acceptable, ​ please​ ​shoot​​ ​us​ ​a​ note​​ ​and​ ​we​ can​​
​clarify.

# [**Problem**​ ​**Description**]{.underline} 

When​ a​ ​ ​consumer​ ​places​ ​an​ ​order​ ​on​ DoorDash,​​ we​ ​ show​ ​ the​ ​ ​expected ​
​time ​ of​ ​ ​delivery.​ ​It​ ​is​ ​very ​ important​ ​ for​

DoorDash to get this right, as it has a big impact on consumer
experience. In this exercise, you will build a model to predict the
estimated time taken for a delivery and write an application that can
make these predictions.

Concretely, for a given delivery you must predict the ​**total delivery
duration seconds** , i.e., the time taken from

> Start:​ ​the​ ​time​ ​consumer​ ​submits​ ​the​ ​order ​ (​ \`created_at\`) ​ to​

End:​ ​when​ ​the​ ​order​ ​will​ ​be​ ​delivered​ to​ ​ ​the​ consumer​​
​(\`actual_delivery_time\`).

To​ ​help​ ​with​ ​this,​ ​we​ ​have​ ​provided

-   **historical_data.csv:**​ ​table​ ​of​ ​historical​ ​deliveries

-   **data_to_predict.json**​: ​ ​Json​ ​list​ ​of​ ​deliveries​ ​that​ ​you​ ​must​
    ​predict​ ​on​ ​(for ​​the​ ​second​ ​part)

-   **data_description.txt**:​ ​ description​ ​ of​ ​ all​ ​ columns​ ​ in​​
    ​**historical_data.csv**​ ​and​ ​details​ of​ **data_to_predict.json**

**[Requirements]{.underline}**

# Part ​ 1​ 

-   Build a model to predict the total delivery duration seconds (as
    defined above). Feel free to generate

additional​ ​features​ ​from​ ​the ​ given​ ​ data​ ​ to​ ​ improve​ ​ model​ ​
performance.​

-   Explain a) model(s) used, b) how you evaluated your model
    performance on the historical data, c) any data processing you
    performed on the data, d) feature engineering choices you made
    and e) other information​ ​you​ ​would​ ​like​ ​us​ ​to​ ​know​ ​about​ ​your​
    ​modeling​ ​approach.

-   Based ​ on​ ​ the​ ​ ​findings ​​from​ ​the​ ​model,​ list​​ ​recommendations​ to​​
    ​reduce​ ​delivery​ ​time

## Deliverables 

-   Submit one document that includes a write-up explaining your model,
    choices made and discussion on the​ ​questions ​ above.​

-   Submit​ ​the​ ​code​ ​used​ ​for​ ​this​ ​part

# Part ​ 2​ 

-   Write an application that accepts data from the json file
    (data_to_predict.json), uses the model to make a prediction for each
    delivery in the json file and writes out predictions to a new ​**tab
    separated file with**​ ​**columns**​ ​**-**​ ​**delivery_id,** ​
    **predicted_delivery_seconds**​ .​

-   Your predictions on this test data set will be evaluated using RMSE
    (Root Mean Squared Error) and your ​ score​ ​ must​ ​ exceed​ ​ a​ ​ baseline​
    ​ set​ ​ for​ ​ the​ ​ ​task.

**NOTE:** For​ this part, you must use a production ready language like
Python, Java, C++, Scala, Ruby, etc. If you are ​ ​unsure​ ​if​ ​your​ ​language​
​of​ ​choice​ ​is​ ​acceptable,​ please​ ​​shoot​ ​us​ ​a​ ​note​ ​and​ ​we​ ​can​ ​clarify.

## Deliverables 

-   Submit​ ​the​ ​output​ ​tsv​ ​file​ ​that​ ​gives ​the​​ ​prediction​ ​for​ ​the​
    ​**Data_to_predict.json**​ data.​

-   Submit your application code. This application (that makes
    predictions) must be runnable from the command line with
    data_to_predict.json passed as input. Include instructions for
    running the code (dependencies,​ ​packages​ ​required,​ ​etc.)

## Notes 

We expect the exercise to take 5-6 hours in total, but feel free to
spend as much time as you like on it. Feel free to​ ​use​ ​any​ ​open​ ​source​
​packages​ ​for​ ​the​ ​task.

**Thank**​ ​**you**​ ​**for**​ ​**your**​ ​**hard**​ ​**work!**​ ​**Please**​ ​**let**​
​**us**​ ​**know**​ ​**if**​ ​**you**​ ​**have**​ ​**any**​ ​**questions.**​ ​**Good**​
​**luck!**
