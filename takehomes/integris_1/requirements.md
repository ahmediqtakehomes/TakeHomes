Data Analyst Take Home

Thank you for taking the next step in the interview process with us at
Integris! We are looking forward to seeing some of your work and thought
process first hand, and hope that you enjoy this exercise. A couple of
things to note:

1)  Please do not spend more than 90 minutes on this exercise. If you
    find that you have hit the 90-minute mark, please stop working and
    send us what you have.

2)  Please send your work product and files back to us directly and
    please DO NOT PUBLISH your work toGitHub directly. This helps us
    ensure that no one else who might be working on this as part of our
    interview process, or just for fun, can see how you\'ve handled the
    exercise.

3)  This exercise will come up again in our interview process, should
    you move forward. It will be discussed either in a phone interview,
    or in your onsite interview session.

Should you have any questions about this exercise, please reach out to
us directly - we are always happy to help.

Have some fun with this! We are excited to see what you come up with.

Cheers!
