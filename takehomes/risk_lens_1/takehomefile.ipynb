    "\n",
    "This is the Data Science candidate take-home task for candidates\n",
    "interviewing to join the Data Science team at RiskLens in Spokane, WA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this task is to allow the candidate to explore some\n",
    "industry-relevant cybersecurity incident data, and allow for the hiring\n",
    "manager to see a sample of the candidate\\'s work using data that the\n",
    "candidate has probably not seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "See the data directory for the data set and data description. We are\n",
    "using data from the VERIS Community Database (VCDB) that has been\n",
    "filtered and transformed to be more easily workable in a few hours. The\n",
    "data has been filtered to be only incidents from the healthcare\n",
    "industry.\n",
    "\n",
    " You should further filter the data to the years 2010-2018 (inclusive of both).\n",

    "Please create a **reproducible report** answering the following\n",
    "questions.:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Complete an exploratory analysis of the data set and answer at least\n",
    "    the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  How many total incidents are in the database for each year?\n",
    "    2.  Grouping by `action` and year, what are some trends in the action types that you notice over time? Please note that since this is an open source database, the total number of incidents in a given year is more of a function of community involvement in incident reporting than a good representation of the total number of incidents. Given this fact, for your trend analysis it may be better to look at proportions of actions for each action type in a given year rather than total number of incidents for a given action.\n",
    "    3. Repeat step B but for `actor`.\n",
    "    4.  Repeat step B but for `asset`.\n",
    "    5.  Repeat step B but for the three `attribute` variables.\n",
    "    6.  Do we see a trend for the proportion of incidents within the US versus outside of the US?\n",
    "    7.  Please feel free to share any other notable findings as you explore the data.\n",

    "        medical records that will be compromised in such an incident\n",
    "        (minimum and maximum)? Within that 90% confidence interval, what is the most likely count of the breached records? You may ignore those employers with unknown employee counts for the sake of time. Bonus points if you integrate the year of breach into your model -- are the trends changing?\n",
