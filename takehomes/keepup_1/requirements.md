For this exercise, you will analyze a dataset from Amazon. The data
format and a sample entry are shown on the next page.

# A. (Suggested duration: 90 mins) 

With the given data for 548552 products, perform exploratory analysis
and make suggestions for further analysis on the following aspects.

# 1. Trustworthiness of ratings 

Ratings are susceptible to manipulation, bias etc. What can you say
(quantitatively speaking) about the ratings in this dataset?

# 2. Category bloat 

Consider the product group named \'Books\'. Each product in this group
is associated with categories. Naturally, with categorization, there are
tradeoffs between how broad or specific the categories must be.

For this dataset, quantify the following:

a.  Is there redundancy in the categorization? How can it be
    identified/removed?

b.  Is is possible to reduce the number of categories drastically (say
    to 10% of existing categories) by sacrificing relatively few
    category entries (say close to 10%)?

**B. (Suggested duration: 30 mins)**

Give the number crunching a rest! Just think about these problems.

# 1. Algorithm thinking 

How would build the product categorization from scratch, using
similar/co-purchased information?

# 2. Product thinking 

Now, put on your \'product thinking\' hat.

a.  Is it a good idea to show users the categorization hierarchy for
    items?

b.  Is it a good idea to show users similar/co-purchased items?

c.  Is it a good idea to show users reviews and ratings for items?

d.  For each of the above, why? How will you establish the same?
