Growth Analyst: Skills Assessment

# Background 

Springboard would like to experiment with different payment options to
determine which ones lead to highest student completion (and retention).
There are two payment options under consideration:

1.  **Upfront: ​**The student pays upfront for most or all of the course
    in return for a discount

2.  **Subscription:​** The student pays month-to-month for as long as
    they take to complete the course, with an option to cancel at any
    time

Our courses typically have two structures:

> 1\. **Fixed-length:​** Students have to finish the course in a fixed
> amount of time 2. **Self-paced:​** Students can take as long as they
> like, and pay as they go

We have run a few different experiments in the past and have collected
data around 3 of our courses. Here's some context about each of these
courses.

The ​*Option available from​* column indicates the cohort for which both
payment options were

available. We have cohorts starting approximately every month.

# Challenge 

[This spreadsheet]{.underline}​ contains the data we collected over a few
months for each of these courses. Your task is to use this data to
recommend to Springboard which payment option (if any) is the better
one. Here are some questions to help you guide your analysis:

A.  Do you have any hypotheses around why the choice of payment option
    (upfront or subscription) should be correlated to completion rates?

B.  Can you summarize and visualize the data in a compact manner,
    preferably in as few charts as possible?

C.  Can you draw any conclusions around whether one option is better
    than the other? Does the course structure play a role?

D.  What recommendations would you make to Springboard as a business?

E.  What are some questions you'd want to explore further or experiments
    that you'd recommend that Springboard runs?

# Deliverables 

1.  A short slide deck (fewer than 10 slides) summarizing your analysis

2.  Your actual analysis (spreadsheet, code, etc). You can use any tools
    or languages of your choice.

*Please treat this assignment as if you were a colleague, and feel free
to email me any questions to validate your assumptions. Please state any
assumptions you make clearly in your submission.*
