# CleanSpark Python Exercise: June 2019

This repository (\"clsk-python-exercise-june-2019 \") is where we
(CleanSpark) host the take-home Python exercise for the Junior Data
Scientist/Analyst position. Please carefully read this entire document
before continuing. There is a fair amount of scaffolding in this repo
to ensure everyone starts on an even playing field. This scaffolding
includes packages that you may not be familiar with; however, we
outline their primary usage below. Learning to work with new
open-source packages is a core skill required for any successful
Python developer.

# Getting started

```
Note from IQ Staff: There were steps here for installing and user
pip and pipenv, these has been removed since the required packages
are already in Google Colab
```


# Running tests

It is commonly accepted that code without tests is bad code. For that
reason, all production code is thoroughly tested at CleanSpark. Python
code is verified using the `pytest` package. The good news is, we had
already installed `pytest` and written tests for you.

We need to make sure you know how to run the tests we have
written. Run the following command inside of your virtual environment:
```
!python -m pytest
```
You should see that all the tests
are  failing. It is your job to get these tests to pass by writing
code. Keep reading for a description of the code you will need to
write. The code of `billing_unit_test.py` is included below

```python
"""Unit test suite for clsk.billing."""

from math import isclose

import pytest

import billing


def test_energy_charge():  # noqa: D103
    # Arrange ----------------------------------------------------------------
    data = billing._get_data()
    # Act --------------------------------------------------------------------
    result = billing.energy_charge(data)
    # Assert -----------------------------------------------------------------
    assert isclose(result, 7429.879999999999, rel_tol=1e-4)


def test_demand_charge():  # noqa: D103
    # Arrange ----------------------------------------------------------------
    data = billing._get_data()
    # Act --------------------------------------------------------------------
    result = billing.demand_charge(data)
    # Assert -----------------------------------------------------------------
    assert isclose(result, 2240.0, rel_tol=1e-4)

```

*NOTE: You should not alter
`billing_unit_test.py`. These tests were written for you to pass
and to expose you to how to write tests in Python.*

# Problem Description

## Energy and Power

At CleanSpark we analyze electricity bills every day. In general, an
electricity bill is composed of two primary parts: energy charges and
maximum-power (demand) charges. In order to understand these two
portions of the bill, we must first understand the difference between
energy and power.

One helpful analogy is between electricity consumption and driving
your car. In order to understand this better, let's use a concrete
example. Imagine you want to drive from San Diego to San Francisco this
weekend. After checking Google Maps, you know that you need to travel
roughly 500 miles.

Now, let's assume someone asked you how long it will take you to get
to San Francisco. What would you say? ... Hopefully, you thought to
yourself, I don't have enough information. I need to know how fast
I am driving in order to know how long it will take."

This is because time and distance require a speed (or rate) to convert
between the two. You may recall the familiar definition of a rate:

$$
\rm speed = \frac{\rm distance}{\rm time}
$$

Now, assume I also told you that you will be traveling at an average
speed of 60 mph over your 500 mile journey to San Francisco and then
asked you how long it would take. Using our definition of speed (rate)
we can easily calculate the time required to get to San Francisco:

$$
{\rm time} = \frac{\rm distance}{\rm speed} = \frac{\rm 500 \, miles}{\rm 60 \, mph} = \rm{8.\bar{3} \, h}
$$

Extending the example above to electricity we can say that energy is
to distance what power is to speed. However the units can be a bit
tricky. Energy is measured in kWh and power is measured in kW. In
order to provide some more context, let\'s assume a building consumed
50 kWh over a 30 minute period and I asked you what the averave power
was. Well extending our formula from above:
$$
{\rm power} = \frac{\rm energy}{\rm time} = \frac{\rm 50 \, kWh}{\rm 0.5 \, h} = {\rm 100 \, kW}
$$
Now that you understand energy and power we can discuss how energy
bills are typically calculated.

## Electricity bills

As mentioned before, energy bills have two primary components: energy
and max-power (demand). These two portions are calculated in
completely different ways. We will first discuss energy and then
max-power (demand).

Energy rates have units of \$/kWh and are calculated at every 15
minute interval. For example, if the energy rate is

\$0.01/kWh and the building consumed 100 kWh of energy over that 15
minute interval, they are charged \$1.00. This occurs at every 15
minute interval in the month and all of the charges get summed up.
This sum of energy charges is the energy portion of your bill.

*Note: This operation is very similar to a dot product.*

Max-power (demand) rates have units of \$/kW and are calculated only
once per month. For example, for an entire month of data let\'s assume
the maximum average power (demand) in a single interval was 100 kW and
the demand rate is \$20/kW.

The customer would be they are charged \$2000 once for that month.

## Problem

You are given a month electricity consumption data (kWh) in 15 minute
intervals for a commercial facility located in San Diego, CA. This data
can be read into a pandas DataFrame using the pre-coded `_get_data`
function in the cell below. Each interval is labeled with the
time it began and all intervals are 15 minutes long. Your task is to
add logic to the two stubbed functions in the cell below module. The
first method is called `energy_charge` and the second is called `demand_charge`.

An example pricing scheme (electricity tariff) is outlined below. Your
functions will need to use the electricity consumption data and the
pricing scheme to calculate the energy and demand charges. Please feel
free to import any other third party packages you think you will need. In additions, feel free to
write as many extra helper functions as you need and include them in
the cell below file as well.

## Energy rates

|Period|Rate|
|---|---|
|Weekends| \$0.05/kWh|1
|Weekdays (12:00 am - 4:00 pm)| \$0.20/kWh|
|Weekdays (4:00 pm - 9:00 pm)| \$0.30/kWh|
|Weekdays (9:00 pm - 12:00 am)| \$0.10/kWh|

## Demand rates

**Monthly max:** \$20/kW

## Correct Solution

You will know if you have implemented the logic correctly when you run
your tests and both of them pass.
