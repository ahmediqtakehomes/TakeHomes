# Description
This is a pre-interview task for the position of **data scientist**
at BusinessOptics.

The goal of this task is to fit a statistical model to historical credit
data and then use the model to estimate the value of current loans. The
task is broken up into five steps which are explained in detail below.

This is a relatively straightforward task and should not take you too
long to complete. We would like you to complete the task using a python
notebook and a number of commonly-used data science libraries. We would
like you to demonstrate that you have some familiarity with some core
concepts in data science and that you either are familiar enough with
the particular technologies or can use online resources to become
familiar enough to solve the task. Within these parameters there are
still many ways to solve the task. If necessary you can make (and note)
assumptions about the data and the interpretation of the task.


# Assignment Steps 
The first step sets up the environment that we would like you to use to
solve the task. The remaining steps take you through the process of
building, evaluating and using the model to solve the task.


*[Note from IQ staff: this section originally included a step about install anaconda. 
Since we provide our takehomes in Google Colab, we excluded this step.
You should definately know how to install anaconda and any python package
if you want any data science job]*


## 2. Load the data and explore relationships

Load the supplied comma-separated data file `data_science_task.csv` using
pandas `read_csv` function -
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html

Each line in the dataset represents a loan. Each loan has the following
fields:

-   `account_no` - A unique account number per loan

-   `gender` - The gender of the account holder - either `"M"` or `"F"``

-   `age` - The age of the account holder at the point of application

-   `income` - The monthly net income of the account holder at the point
    of application

-   `loan_amount` - The amount of money lent

-   `term` - The number of months that the loan is to be repaid over

-   `installment_amount` - The monthly installment amount

-   `insterest_rate` - The interest rate on the loan

-   `credit_score_at_application` -The credit score at the point of
    application, this is a positive integer less than 1000. The higher
    the score the more creditworthy the applicant is believed to be.

-   `outstanding_balance` - The remaining amount of the loan that still
    has to be repaid

-   `status` - This indicates what state the account is in. This field can
    take one of three values
    - `"LIVE"`: The loan is still being repaid - the field `outstanding_balance` will be greater than zero.
    -   `"PAID_UP"`: The loan has been completely repaid - the field
        `outstanding_balance` will be zero.
    -   `"DEFAULT"`: The loan was not fully repaid and no further payments can
        be expected - the field `outstanding_balance` will be greater than
        zero and the amount will not be recoverable.

In order to get a sense of the distribution of the fields and the
relationships between the fields make some plots using the pandas
dataframe `plot` function - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html

An example plot could be a histogram of a particular field (such as the
histogram of income plotted below) or a scatter plot to indicating the
relationship between variables. Don't spend too long on these plots,
they needn't be beautiful nor do they need to be exhaustive. The idea is
simply to demonstrate that you can visualize relationships in the
dataset.

## 3. Fit a probabilistic classification model

Separate the data into two data sets a current and a historical data
set. Use the status field to do this, historical data has status
`"PAID_UP"` or `"DEFAULT"` current data has the status `"LIVE"`.

Using a probabilistic classification algorithm of your choice from
scikit-learn (http://scikitlearn.org/), fit a probability of default
model to the historical data.

In order to evaluate this model (the next step) you will need to create
a backtesting or hold-out set which you will not use to fit the model
with. You can do this using scikit-learn's `model_selection` package or
using your own method.

You will need to decide how to encode the categorical fields in the
data - you can use pandas `get_dummies` or the label and one hot encoders
from scikit-learn.

***Important note***: You ***MUST NOT*** use the `outstanding_balance` field as
one of the predictors as this field is by definition perfectly
correlated with the default variable you are trying to predict.

## 4. Evaluate your model

Choose a suitable evaluation metric from scikit-learn's `metrics` package .
Use your fitted model to predict the probabilities of default for the
test data set. Use the scikit-learn functionality to calculate the
metric based on the actual test set outcomes and the predicted test set
outcomes.

## 5. Use model to forecast value of book

Finally, use your fitted model to predict the probability of default for
each of the loans in the current dataset. Use this probability to
calculate the expected repayment amount for each loan (this is just one minus the predicted probability of default multiplied
by the `outstanding_amount`). In this calculation you can disregard any impact of
the time value of money.

Sum all the expected repayment amounts to find the total expected value
of the book.

You can verify that this total repayment amount roughly reflects the
average default rate observed in the historical data by computing the
ratio of the expected value to the sum of the outstanding_amount and
comparing it to the proportion number of `"PAID_UP"` to the number of
`"DEFAULT"` accounts in the historical data set.
