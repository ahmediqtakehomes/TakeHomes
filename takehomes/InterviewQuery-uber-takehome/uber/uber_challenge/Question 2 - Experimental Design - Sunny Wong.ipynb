    "    - I would define the KPI as the average number of trips compeleted during peak hours per driver.\n",

    "    i) average duration of trips per driver (are drivers only prefer taking shorter trips now to meet the 5 trip quota ?)\n",

    "We are interested in testing a hypotheses: whether the incentive provided increase average number of trips compeleted during peak hours per driver. Since the metrics are averages over iid drivers (assuming we randomized correctly), we know the corresponding distributions should be normal, a 2 sample t-test will suffice to determine if the difference in avg trips completed is statistical significant.\n",

    "In addition, also can compare with other past campaigns by Uber, marketing efforts in the same market, or compare to other markets that are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key challenge is that since it is a billboard, it is hard to directly assoicate whether a new customer is attracted due to the billboard and not other marketing promos.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude I think is important to say context is very important. Maybe campaign is great method but lots of issues like billboard location is bad (low traffic, not align with target customer's locations), maybe bad timing because tons of other ads around or big event in town, maybe competitor has better ads/promos at the moment, or the billboard design is not good so hard to attract attention/interest."
