<A name=1></a>TAKE-HOME CHALLENGE: Data Science - Analytics<br>
Airbnb is a two sided marketplace which matches guests to hosts. The booking flow at Airbnb is as follows: a guest<br>
finds an available room (listing) that they like, and then they contact the host. Once the guest finds a listing they<br>
are interested in, there are three ways to send the host an inquiry: `contact_me', `book_it', or `instant_book'<br>
(detailed at the bottom of this document). Upon receiving the inquiry, the host can then decide whether or not to<br>
accept the request (for `contact_me' and `book_it' methods -- `instant_book` is auto-accepted). One of our goals at<br>
Airbnb is to increase bookings on our platform.<br>
Prompt:<br>
You are the first data scientist to join a cross-functional Product and Operations team working to grow bookings in<br>
Rio de Janeiro. The team asks you for help with the following:<br>
1.<br>
What key metrics would you propose to monitor over time the success of the team's efforts in improving<br>
the guest host matching process and why? Clearly define your metric(s) and explain how each is<br>
computed.<br>
2.<br>
What areas should we invest in to increase the number of successful bookings in Rio de Janeiro? What<br>
segments are doing well and what could be improved?  Propose 2-3 specific recommendations (business<br>
initiatives and product changes) that could address these opportunities. Demonstrate rationale behind<br>
each recommendation AND prioritize your recommendations in order of their estimated impact.<br>
3.<br>
There is also interest from executives at Airbnb about the work you are doing, and a desire to understand<br>
the broader framing of the challenge of matching supply and demand, thinking beyond the data provided.<br>
What other research, experiments, or approaches could help the company get more clarity on the<br>
problem?<br>
Your assignment:</span><span class="ft3"> </span><span class="ft7">S</span><span class="ft3">ummarize your recommendations in response to the questions above in a 5-8 slide<br>
presentation intended for the Head of Product and VP of Operations (who is not technical). Include an organized<br>
appendix sharing the details of your work conducted for the Rio team, that would be useful for the data team to<br>
understand your work.<br>
Instructions:<br>
1) Create a PDF of your presentation.<br>
2) Append all code you use to analyze results to the above PDF, including code used for initial data<br>
exploration. We typically see data processed in SQL/R/Python and a presentation with results made in<br>
Keynote/Google slides/Powerpoint. But you are welcome to use any software you feel comfortable with.<br>
If you use Excel, please document the operations used to process the data, and append your spreadsheet.<br>
3) Please do NOT include your name or email address on this PDF.<br>
4) You will have 4 days to complete the assignment.<br>
<hr>
<A name=2></a>Grading:<br>
Your assignment will be judged according to:<br>
1) The analytical approach and clarity of your graphs, tables, visualizations,<br>
2) The data decisions you made and reproducibility of the analysis,<br>
3) Strength of recommendations, prioritizations, and rationale behind those,<br>
4) The narrative of your presentation and ability to effectively communicate to non-technical executives,<br>
5) How well you followed the directions.<br>

Further Information:<br>
There are three ways to book a listing on Airbnb:<br>
1) contact_me - The guests writes a message to the host to inquire about the listing. The host has the option<br>
to 1) pre-approve the guest to book their place, or 2) they can reject, or 3) they can write a free text<br>
message with no explicit acceptance or rejection. If the host pre-approves, the guest can then go ahead<br>
and click to make the booking (but is not obligated to).<br>
<hr>
<A name=3></a>2) book_it - The guest puts money down to book the place directly, but the host has to accept the<br>
reservation request. If the host accepts, the booking happens automatically. If you have used Airbnb<br>
before, this shows up as a button labeled "Request to book".<br>
3) instant_book - The guest books the listing directly, without any need for the host to accept or reject<br>
actively (it is auto-accepted by the host). This shows up as a button labeled "Book".<br>
Note: A host can opt-in to the `instant_book` feature. If a host does so, a guest can use the `contact_me` or<br>
`instant_book` channels for booking that particular listing, but cannot use the `book_it` functionality. Alternatively,<br>
if a host does not opt in, a guest can use the `contact_me` or `book_it` channels only. We suggest that you browse<br>
the Airbnb website and look at listings to see the different ways that you can message a host.<br>
