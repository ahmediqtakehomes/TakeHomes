"Low Blood Pressure And Hypotension Question","Hi, at night when I fall asleep suddenly I am woken to a racing heart, and my brain feels weird. My blood pressure tends to be around 105/90, that is after standing up and walking to nurses station. I am wandering if my BP is going to low at night...not helped by the fact that I struggle with panic disorder...so symptoms are alike. I am just feeling like something other than panic is going on. Not on any medication, other than Hardys daily essential nutrients. Thank you""Low Blood Pressure And Hypotension Question","I have low blood pressure and a high heart rate. Im 161cm tall and average at 45kg. I eat twice as much as everyone i know. I'm always feeling cold but I radiate so much body heat that my partner can't sleep close to me. I can't find anything on the Internet about this. My dr checked my thyroid and said it's fine...""Low Blood Pressure And Hypotension Question","I am a 36 yo female. I am 5.2 135 lbs. I dont smoke or drink. Over the past 4 years I have been have bouts with dizziness and confusion. I can't stand up for more than a couple of minutes with out getting dizzy . If I bend down I have the same feeling. I get disoriented and feel faint. I have had bouts of vertigo that last week's. Sometimes sitting at work I will get dizzy and confused. I have to get up and move around. I walk fast to try to avoid feeling too dizzy to make it. My doctor (3rd dr in 2 yrs) checked my thyroid and its normal so he says it's depression and referred me to psych. I am not depressed about any thing except feeling disabled. I was reviewing all medical records. I found my blood pressure is always around 110/70. The variances are like 108/70 and 110/62. I have numbness in my left leg. My doctor sent me to physical therapy. I didn't injure myself it just went numb. I now spend most of my time in bed. I cant even make it through a grocery store. What is this?""Low Blood Pressure","Is there such a thing as blood pressure that is too low? My blood pressure is consistently around 98/65. It seems like that would be good if I were athletic and ate a healthy diet. But, i'm about 100 lbs overweight, don't diet, and exercise very little. Does anyone know if it is normal to have low blood pressure and an unhealthy lifestyle?""Low Blood Pressure After I Eat Meat","I`m 35 year old male. 180 cm high, 87 kg. Since 2015 i experienced low blood pressure after lunch if i eat meat. Meat like chicken, pork, beef, even fish. So i think it is somethink assosiated with protein syntesis. After meal with meat i feel very bad, i mean, my back side of the head is with pain like someone hitted me with wood. Espessially right side of the back side. After i changed my diet now i have no problem with the pressure. But i dont eat meat. No problems with diary foods. "Treating Orthostatic Hypotension ,"My mother entered the hospital 39 days ago due to bleeding from her intestinal tract. After tests they determined it was a case of diverticulitis. While she was there she became orthostatic hypotensive where the blood pressure dropped significantly that she passes out. She has had dizzy spells in the past but not to this degree. About 3 years ago she was diagnosed by a neuro surgeon that she had stenosis and it was recommend that she remove the bulging disk from her neck but she decided not to. Getting back to OH, doctors have tired most all the standard techniques and medication combination to treat this but with no success. She finally had surgery last week on the neck with hopes that the nerves being compressed may alleviate the blood pressure control, but so far that did not help. Cardiologist suggest we try a pacemaker to help control the beats per minute of her heart to increase flow. Another cardiologist suggested this won't work and preferred we try Mestinon and Midodrine. They installed the pacemaker and the next day they tried to get her up and the blood pressure still dropped. The doctor instructed the nurse to administer the Mestinon and Midodrine in the morning before trying to get her up. Heart maybe pump more blood, but it's still going down to the lower extremities. Anyone have any inputs of where to go from here? Is this it and she is bed ridden for the rest of her life, which they suggest may be limited due to the fact she is bed ridden or wheel chair ridden?""Ways To Stop Syncope Epidsode","Does anyone know of ways to stop the loss of consciousness and prevent a syncope episode? I know about staying hydrated, applied tension, and avoiding triggers. I'm asking if there is anything more certain or absolute other than lying down? Like an epipen for fainting? I would think that you would need something to compensate the sudden drop in blood pressure. The first thing that comes to my mind is some kind a lower body compression. Something like a fighter pilot g suit. The other thing I thought of was the ammonia tablets that are inhaled to ""wake"" people back up. I don't know much about these though or if they really do anything to stop syncope. I don't know how that would do anything for blood pressure. Thanks for the help!""Syncope : Bodily Movement And Open Eyes","I have suffered from fainting spells most of my life that have all been triggered by pain. Not all types of pain, but specific, mostly sharper pain. Recently, I accidentally cut the tip of my index finger, and it started bleeding profusely, and my first instinct was to lie down to prevent falling and injuring myself in case I did faint immediately. I lied on the floor for about a minute, and felt better and then got back up. Which was a mistake because my body did not fully recover. I sat on a couch, and my head and ears got very hot, and then feeling overwhelmed, I closed my eyes. I could not shake it off. What seemed like hours, but was really about 2 minutes, I woke up again very slowly, trying to piece back together where I was. First, my hearing comes back, and I ask myself 'where am I'? Once I hear familiar things, I cry because of the confused feeling of being 'gone' or having 'left' without knowing. My brain completely reboots. During the episode, I felt like I was searching for something, and I try to make sense of things while in the 'dream'. I find myself in unspecific 'alternate realities' where I find some security, even though I'm still searching. My husband has witnessed me fainting twice, and both times I have moved waving my arms and legs around, with my eyes open, and empty expression. Even though my eyes are closed, when I faint, my husband says they snap back open, with a 'zombie-like' expression that scares him. In my dreams I cannot see even though my eyes are open. I cannot see anything specific, though, I feel like I've been to a thousand different places. I wonder if it could have been a seizure. He tells me that I don't move very jerky or fast, and I have not had any muscle pain from over exertion like if I had a seizure. And my eyes do not roll back into my head. I wonder why this happens. I am not afraid of the sight of blood. That does not make me faint. From my experience I have drunken cold water and sometimes it prevents it altogether. It's almost like I faint so severely that my brain goes dead for a second. I have had an MRI or CAT scan (I cant remember which) when I was younger, that came back normal. Maybe my body has a low pain threshold? Things like needles, knee scrapes and stubbing my toe have not made me faint either. Also, the pain that I actually feel is not that immense. When I cut my finger, I was not screaming or in a lot of actual pain. My body overreacts. Next time I'll stay lying down for at least 15 minutes to attempt to prevent it. What really concerns me is the movement and open eyes. Why does this happen?""Symptoms Of Low Blood Pressure","Hi there. In my family, there is a heredity of low blood pressure. Thats why I'm translating these symptoms as low blood pressure. I feel dizziness or lightheadedness , have a blurred vision and nausea, I'm thirsty all the time .... tired ... Am I overreacting or .... I'm having low blood pressure ?""Low Blood Pressure And Weight Gain","I have been on blood pressure medicine for years. I've been on many diets and it's hard to loose weight no matter what I try. My sister had me use her watch that checks your pulse rate. My pulse was between 63 and 65 (I tried it more than once). That was my resting pulse rate. She thought that was pretty low. We checked my dad's and his was around 75. I'm 49. I go to the gym 3 times a week. My Dad is 79 and has arthritis and doesn't walk much. No matter what diet I try I can't loose weight. I thought after 7 months at the gym I would be loosing weight. After seeing my pulse I remembered about the blood pressure medicine I'm on. I take 50 miliigrams of Atenolol and 20 milligrams of Enalapril every day. Atenolol I remember reading, is a beta blocker and it slows your heart rate down. Is it possible the Atenolol is why my heart rate is so low and actually keeping me from loosing weight? ""Hypotension At 17","i have high blood pressure and hypotension and from time to time when i stand up i get really dizzy and my sight goes all black is there anything i can do to stop this happening""Blood Pressure Number","I have a blood pressure of 194 / 113 with a pulse rate of 45.

When they checked his blood pressure, it was 121/101. I know that the 121 is close to normal, but the other is way off. When I look up something about the blood pressure, everything talks about both being elevated. Of course, they didn't do any procedure because of the blood pressure. But I am not sure what we are suppose to do about it. They said to come back next week, but didn't say what to do about the elevated blood pressure.""Hypotension , Steady Heart Rate , Chest Pain","Here's one for you. It's not me, it's my girlfriend... For some time she has complained of intermittent chest pain. They discovered a blockage in the left ventrical. OK, I'll buy that. Now then, she was perscribed nitro to aleiviate the pain. It does nothing to help. She's on two different medications for hypotension, but she's almost always still low, even after taking them. She also tends to get shakey and sometimes passes out at any given moment regardless of activity. She was just in the hospital for several days where they did pretty much nothing but monitor her blood pressure and let her go when the top number finally reached 92 (still seems low to me). No one seems motivated to really fix the problem, just give a couple meds that only sort of mask things and act as a bandaid for the problem. Thoughts? ""Low Blood Pressure","Ok my bp runs low for about 3.5 years now. It gets lower than the 90/60 here and there. I'm TERRIFIED off getting shock. How low does you guys with low BP run?

I went through respiratory workups & a full cardiac workup - all w/ no problems discovered & no diagnosis. I have since (2 yrs. later) been diagnosed w/ Parkinson's - one symptom of which can be early morning low BP (which can produce the faintness w/ heat/exercise).
