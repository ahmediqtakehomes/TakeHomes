#Uber-DS-Challenge

A data challenge provided by Uber, for a Data Scientist position. 
## Getting started

### Repo structure
Data Challenge instructions and provided data are in `docs/instructions`, and responses to questions are in 
`docs/responses`. Code underlying responses to questions is in `bin/`. 

### Python Environment
Python code in this repo utilizes packages that are not part of the common library. To make sure you have all of the 
appropriate packages, please install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), and install the environment 
described in environment.yml (Instructions [here](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html), under *Use 
environment from file*, and *Change environments (activate/deactivate)*). 

### To run code
Part 1 and Part 2 are example code. They have not been validated against the tables described in the instructions, and
 as such should not be considered compile-ready. 
  
To run the Python code for Part 3, complete the following:
```bash
# Install anaconda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml 

# Activate environment
source activate uber_env

# Run script
cd bin/
python p3.py
```
